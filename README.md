## WorkShop Android

In this workshop we gonna make an application that list your favorite places.

This project gonna be made in 4 steps:
 - [Step-1](https://gjithub.compack.io/v/roubertedgar/workshoptw/tree/step-1) - Creation of project with main screen that contains the list of your favorite places, creation of form screen to add your favorite places that contains name and description
 - [Step-2](https://github.com/roubertedgar/workshoptw/tree/step-2) - Continuation of [Step-1](https://github.com/roubertedgar/workshoptw/tree/step-1), here we gonna work with [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview) to finally have our list of places in the main screen and implements all the things we need to make it works 
 - [Step-3](https://github.com/roubertedgar/workshoptw/tree/step-3) - Until now, we just call the form to add a new place, get the result and put it on the list at the main screen, but we want to persist it, for that we gonna use [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room). 
 - [Step-4](https://github.com/roubertedgar/workshoptw/tree/step-4) - In this step we decide to use [MVVM](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-3-model-view-viewmodel-e7eeee76b73b), an architecture based on data streaming that helps us to have well defined layers with single responsibility.
