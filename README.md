# Defining layers of our project with MVVM

We was making a lot of things on the view, making our activities break the single responsibility principle. So, to avoid this principle breaks, we decide to use  an architecture pattern.

Today we have 3 well know architectures:
- [MVC](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-1-model-view-controller-3baecef5f2b6)	Model View Controller
-	[MVP](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-2-model-view-presenter-8a6faaae14a5) Model View Presenter
-	[MVVM](https://medium.com/upday-devs/android-architecture-patterns-part-3-model-view-viewmodel-e7eeee76b73b) Movel View ViewModel

SÃ³, you should read more about the architectures above, and see what is best for your project. 

In this Step we gonna use MVVM, because it's a stream based architecture, and we are using  once we use ReactiveX to, so, this two things together works very well.
