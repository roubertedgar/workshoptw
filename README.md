After define the application layers wieh MVVM is time to test.

Lets start unitarily tesing PlaceViewModel using Mockito Kotlin, Junit and some features of ReactiveX that helps us test easy.

So, in Place view model we have two interfaces of communication. One is that saves our place and other 
is that interface that loads all places that we have.

Lets start wieh the save mathod:
  The save method receave a place as parameter and return nothing to us. For that reason we use Completable Oberver of ReactiveX.
  Completable emmits no item, just complete a task. So, when we call PlaceViewModel::save(place) we receive a Completable that 
  we can subcribe. 
  
  fun savePlace(place: Place): Completable =
            Completable.fromAction { database.insert(place) }
                    .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
                    .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                    
  To testing this we have to mock the PlaceDAO, create the PlaceViewModel and pass the mock into the constructor.
  After this we can Write the test for the method above. 
  
   @Test
    fun completeWhenSavePlace() {
        viewModel.savePlace(Place("", ""))
                .test()
                .assertNoValues()
                .assertComplete()
    }
    
    So, here we call the viewModel.savePlace that returns to us a Completable oberver from ReactiveX. So, we can use a tool test
    to make some assertions in this oberver. In the case is noValues, one Completable emmits no item, and, assertComplete to make
    sure that save action was succefull. Ok, here we have some problems.
    
     *The PlaceDAO need a rule to execute the task of save item immediately, so:   @get:Rule
    var instantTaskExecutorRule = InstantTaskExecutorRule() solves the problem
    
     *Other problem that we have is that we subcribe on a thead and oberve on MainThread in the view model, it means that
     we are doing this stuff in background to. So we need use the ReactiveX plugins to make sure that all tasks execute immediately
     Here we can crate a Helper that setups the Reactive plugins, making all Schedulers immediate.
     
     object RxSchedulerTestSetup {

    fun setupRxScheduler() {
        val immediate = object : Scheduler() {
            override fun scheduleDirect(@NonNull run: Runnable, delay: Long, @NonNull unit: TimeUnit): Disposable {
                return super.scheduleDirect(run, 0, unit)
            }

            override fun createWorker(): Scheduler.Worker {
                return ExecutorScheduler.ExecutorWorker(Executor { it.run() })
            }
        }

        RxJavaPlugins.setInitIoSchedulerHandler { immediate }
        RxJavaPlugins.setInitComputationSchedulerHandler { immediate }
        RxJavaPlugins.setInitNewThreadSchedulerHandler { immediate }
        RxJavaPlugins.setInitSingleSchedulerHandler { immediate }
        RxAndroidPlugins.setInitMainThreadSchedulerHandler { immediate }
    }

    fun reset() {
        RxAndroidPlugins.reset()
        RxJavaPlugins.reset()
    }
}

After that we need to setup the schedulers calling setupRxScheduler on @Before method in PlaceViewModelTest:

 @Before
    fun setUp() {
        RxSchedulerTestSetup.setupRxScheduler()
        viewModel = PlaceViewModel(dao)
    }
    
 To make sure that all became normal after test we make a reset in @After, like this:
     @After
    fun tearDown() {
        RxSchedulerTestSetup.reset()
    }
    
    Now we can run our first test =D
    
    If is green, we can continue.
    
    So now we can test the getAll method, that should return 0...N Places. SÃ³ we can start testing that values returned by
    getAll is empty. But first. Lets look at the getAll in PlaceDAO
    
     @Query("Select * from Place")
    fun getAll(): Flowable<List<Place>>
    
    PlaceDAO::getAll() returns a Flowable, that is a obervable of ReactiveX, it is like a simple Observable<T> plus BackPressure
    Strategy, but we can avoid this backpressure thing for now, just becouse we can consume all data produced by getAll method.
    
    Ok, now we know what getAll returns we can start our test. It will be like our first tests, but now we can test the values
    returned by the obervable.
    
    Lets start calling viewModel.getAll()
    Once it returns a ReactiveX obervable we can make ".test()" and assert some stuffs, like:
    
    viewModel.getAll().test()
        .assertNoValues()
        .assertComplete()
        
    If we run this test it will give us a null pointer exception. Thats becouse we don't stub the placeDAO.getAll().
    So, when we call placeDAO.getAll() we shoud return a Flowable that respond with a empty value, like:
    whenever(dao.getAll()).thenReturn(Flowable.empty()). The final verions of our test will be like:
    
        @Test
    fun emptyWhenAreNoItemsSaved() {
        whenever(dao.getAll()).thenReturn(Flowable.empty())

        viewModel.getAll().test()
                .assertNoValues()
                .assertComplete()
    }
    
    Ok, we test the empty case. Lets test when we have item...
    
    Following the same path of code above, we have to stubs the responde of placeDAO.getAll(). But now we shound return
    a observable that emmits a item at least.
    
    So... whenever(dao.getAll()).thenReturn(Flowable.just(getPlaces())), the get places method is implemented like
    
     private fun getPlaces(): List<Place> =
            listOf(Place("", ""), Place("", ""))

    Now we can assert that our returned observable contains values.
    
     viewModel.getAll().test()
                .assertValue {
                    it.size == 2 //here we assert 2 itens becouse our getPlaces return 2 places =D, we could make more calls
                    //of assert value asserting values inner each item
                 }.assertComplete() //just to assert that the emmiting is finished
                 
      The final version of our test will be like:
      
          @Test
    fun returnsAllSavedPlacesWhenGetAll() {
        whenever(dao.getAll()).thenReturn(Flowable.just(getPlaces()))

        viewModel.getAll().test()
                .assertValue {
                    it.size == 2
                }.assertComplete()
    }
